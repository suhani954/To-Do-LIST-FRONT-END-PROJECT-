# To-Do-LIST-FRONT-END-PROJECT
**Project Objective:**
To build a clean, responsive, and user-friendly task management web app that helps users organize their work effectively across different stages‚ÄîTo Do, In Progress, and Done‚Äîwith support for reminders and alarms, editing, and deleting tasks.

**Key Features and Functionalities:**
1. Task Creation: Users can enter a task title, description, reminder date/time, and select its initial status (To Do, In Progress, Done). The task appears as a card in the selected column.
2. Three Task Sections:
To Do: Tasks that need to be started.
In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on.
Done: Completed tasks.
3. Drag and Drop: Users can drag a task card from one section to another using HTML5 Drag & Drop API. This allows visual tracking of task progress.
4. Reminder and Alarm Notification: When a reminder time is set, the JavaScript uses setTimeout() to wait until the scheduled time and then triggers an alert() notification. This simulates an alarm for that task.
5. Edit and Update Tasks: Clicking the icon on a task opens a modal popup. Users can modify the title and description, and save the changes.
6. Delete Tasks: Clicking the üóëÔ∏è icon removes the task from the interface.
7. Date Display: The current day and date is shown in the format: Day, DD-month-YYYY.
8. Responsive and Intuitive UI: Styled with CSS for professional appearance. Uses clear sectioning, padding, buttons, and task highlights.

**Technologies Used:**
1. HTML5 ‚Äì For the structure of the web application.
2. CSS3 ‚Äì For styling and layout (responsive & modern design).
3. JavaScript ‚Äì For interactivity, reminders, alarms and drag-and-drop.
